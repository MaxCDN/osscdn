# Frontend

Based mostly on Angular. Uses Grunt, Bower and co. It comes with a standalone server based on Node.js (Express).

In case you want to run it, copy `data.json` generated using walker to `/dist` and either run `./serve.js` or `grunt server`. The latter is very useful during development. Note that it requires Ruby/Compass. Before running either you'll likely want to `grunt install` and `npm install` dependencies.
